The large number of murals preserved in the **Potala Palace** reproduces the history of the Tibetan people's social life in various fields. They are important cultural heritage of the Chinese nation and human history. In order to preserve the murals of Potala Palace forever, with the support of the Palace, the collection team of Yachang Culture Group Chinese Art Data Center has worked relentlessly for four years and completed the data collection job for the murals systematically and thoroughly. This is the first time this job has done for **Potala Palace**.
